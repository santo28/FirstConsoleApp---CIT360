# FirstConsoleApp---CIT360
Create a new Visual C# Console App using .NET Framework project and name it "MyFirstConsoleApplication."
Create two variables to store your values:
Your name
Your location (state or country)
Output two WriteLine statements that display those two variables with proper labels (My name is ... , I am from ...) using String Interpolation.
Output the current date, but not the current time. (Ex: 04/06/1830)
Output the number of days until Christmas this year and, of course, apply an appropriate label to that output.
Add the program example from section 2.1 in the C# Programming Yellow Book by Rob Miles.
Add these requirements to the code:
Provide appropriate text labels when requesting dimensional input.
Cause the program to pause in the console so that the application does not automatically terminate when launched from the Visual Studio run debugger tool. 
END
